**Latest regular products**

At present, we have been in a volatile market, in order to avoid the loss of income caused by the fluctuation of the market. At the same time, it is also to give back to the loyal irons who are optimistic about the Ares project for a long time. After a series of discussions, the team decided to launch a regular product with a higher annualized rate of return.

With immediate effect, we are launching the following regular pledge mining products: The regular is currently divided into 3 levels, namely 60 days, 120 days and 180 days. The annualized rate of return for 60 days is 35%; the annualized rate of return for 120 days is 40%; the annualized rate of return for 180 days is 45%

Precautions

* After purchasing a regular product, the principal cannot be redeemed within the specified time, but the reward can be collected at any time.

* To purchase regular products, if you want to purchase regular products during the pledged mining time, you need to extend the overall period. Redemption days = completion days before additional purchase + regular days (60/120/180)

For example, Xiao Ming uses 100 $ARES to pledge mining for 60 days on a regular basis. After 30 days, 

he decides to spend another 100 $ARES to purchase a 60-day pledge for mining.

In this way, 200 $ARES will take 90 days to redeem. The income at this time is approximately: 100*35%÷12+200*35%÷6

* After the regular product expires, it can be redeemed. If it is not redeemed in time, the system will give the corresponding income according to the cycle you choose.

For example, Xiaoli chooses to use 100 $ARES to order 120 days of products, and her annualized rate of return is 40%, and she will not redeem it until 150 days. So Xiaoli's income at this time is about: 100*40%÷12*5

We sincerely invite you to choose the appropriate cycle according to your own needs and participate in our regular pledge mining activities!
