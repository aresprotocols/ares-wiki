### Crowdloan
Ares Protocol continues to participate in the Kusama ****Parachain Slot Auction, currently officially launched crowd-loan for Kusama.

Mars is a canary network built by Ares Protocol on Kusama. It will conduct some contract call tests for asset prices. If tested in a real environment, it will be deployed on the Ares Protocol mainnet.

After a successful auction of the Kusama slot, Ares Protocol will provide Kusama with native oracle support, support the Ink contract ecology, and bring better oracle services to Defi developers.

**Mars token $AMAS**

Mars token ($AMAS) will be used for contract call tests for some asset prices, in the meantime, it will be used for community governance and other functions.

The initial issuance of $AMAS reaches 1 billion in total. 50% will be used for slot auction, no private round investment and team holding, committed to becoming a community governed token. Any community user who takes a certain amount of $AMAS can become an aggregator node in the Mars network.

### Auction strategy

Mars is currently running a Crowdloan campaign at polkadot.js.org. The serial number is “2008” and slots of 8 cycles will be auctioned, i.e., the leasing period is 6 weeks *8=48 weeks.

The current rules are:

1. Support 1 KSM for 1000 AMAS;

2. When the total amount of KSM staking by Mars crowd-loan exceeds 50,000, users will receive 1200 AMAS for each $1 KSM they support, i.e., the fixed ratio is adjusted to KSM: AMAS = 1:1200.

Up to 300,000,000 AMAS will be distributed to KSM contributors. After the successful auction, the rewards will be distributed linearly until the ending of the crowd-loan. In the future, AMAS might be listed in the exchanges according to its popularity or converted into ARES in a certain proportion. Mars will become a canary network with economic value.
