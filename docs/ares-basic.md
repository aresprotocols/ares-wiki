Hello to the Ares community, you are here! Welcome

Ares communityüëè. Next, it will take you to the world of "Ares Protocol, the first decentralized cross-chain oracle service protocol in the Polkadot Ecology".

Ares is the first oracle project in the Polkadot Ecosystem. It is the first oracle to achieve verification on the data chain. It is also the first project to compensate data users for business losses due to the use of oracle data. What can Ares do? For decentralized financial DeFi, Ares provides high-precision, real-time, safe and reliable off-chain data. For each of us, Ares is more like a decentralized big data software, which will provide us with more high-quality real-time data services. It solves the problem of identity confirmation and data confirmation of IoT terminals, and reconstructs all aspects of life in our life such as supply chain, food safety, traceability, and smart home. At the same time, it can also use the wisdom of the crowd to predict the outcome of a series of activities such as presidential elections and sports betting. For the current popular blockchain games and NFTs, Ares will also provide verifiable random numbers on the chain to empower them with more ways to play.
