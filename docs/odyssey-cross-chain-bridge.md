Ares Odyssey is a real economic system where participants can map 1:1 ARES-ERC20 or ARES-BEP20 assets into Odyssey for staking, nominating or experiencing on-chain data request functionality. The proceeds earned therein will remain in the Odyssey network and can be withdrawn by users via the Odyssey — ETH or Odyssey — BSC cross-chain bridges, mapped 1:1 to ARES-ERC20 or ARES-BEP20 assets.
