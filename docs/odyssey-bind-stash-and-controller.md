Select the stash account and the corresponding controller account. The stash and the controller can be the same account, however, this is not recommended in practice. Fill in the amount of value bonded as required, then the staking value will be deducted from the stash account.
* The stash account can be regarded as your cold wallet, and all operation of funds is controlled by the stash account.
* Other non-fund operations are done by the controller account (such as setting session keys, setting commission, participating in voting, releasing pledges, etc.)
* Do not use all the available balance for staking as you would need to reserve some for the transaction fee.

After filling in the above information, click the Bond button to complete the staking operation.
