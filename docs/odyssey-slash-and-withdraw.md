## Punishment verification

After you successfully become a validator node, you will continue to participate in block generation and quotation. The system will check in real time whether the validator has a block in the corresponding session. If there is no block, it will submit a “heartbeat request” (the validator program will automatically submit it) to prove that the validator is online. At the end of the session cycle, the node who has no block generated or heartbeat sent will be reported, and the reported validator will be punished.

### How to check if a node is penalized?

Enter the Staking page and click on the Slashes tab. When the page displays “unapplied”, no one is penalized.

If the penalty list where your account address is displayed appears on the tab page, you need to accept the punishment of kicking out of the validator set and deducting the penalty corresponding to the deposit.

## Extraction of assets
