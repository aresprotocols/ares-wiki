### What stage has ares reached? What are the plans for 2021?

At present, ares is preparing to launch the first phase version of gladios test network. Meanwhile, Ares pledge mining on Ethereum is also under intense testing.
Next, we will have more Oracle functions online:

* Distributed data source weight adjustment
* Node random select based on VRF
* Aggregation of multi node prices in a chain
* Challenger's on Chain Verification
* Ink contract ecology

At the same time, we will also focus on brand promotion and operation, and will achieve strategic cooperation with more ecological projects.


**The planning of Ares in 2021 is mainly divided into several aspects**

1. The launch of the next version of gladios test network is related to the promotion of product function research and development. It can make the defi project get more secure and reliable price service.

2. Community development, building ares community ambassadors and technical ambassadors, so that more  partners who want to know ares can participate in the Ares family. If you have your own unique views on publicity and technology, you are welcome to keep in touch with us at any time.

3. At present, we also actively cooperate with ecological projects closely. For example, crust, bandot and other projects.

4. Ares will set up the ink ecological fund. Welcome to use the ink contract to build the defi application. You can get all kinds of data on the chain for free. If you are interested, you can apply for our grant.

5. In Polkadot's slot auction, Ares pays close attention to this dynamic, has built PC1 test, and is doing Rococo docking.

6. The Ares ecological marathon welcomes individuals or technical teams who use the Ares Oracle service to participate in the ecological construction, and will provide rich funds to reward participants.
