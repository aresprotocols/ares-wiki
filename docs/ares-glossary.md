|    |Terms|Explanation|English|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|1|Decentralized Application (Dapp)|Applications running on a decentralized network, with the characteristics of open source, decentralization, and motivating users.|Dapp|
|2|Web3 Foundation|The Web3 Foundation is a Swiss foundation established by Dr. Gavin Wood, focusing on the development, deployment and maintenance of Web3. The Web3 Foundation is committed to promoting technological innovation and application development in decentralized software protocols empowered by cryptography. The goal of the Web3 Foundation is to cultivate and serve the most advanced technologies and applications at all levels of the Web3 technology stack. The core of Web3 is to research, develop, deploy, fund and maintain Web3 technology, as well as support middleware and underlying demo applications.|Web3 Foundation|
|3|Byzantine Fault Tolerance|Byzantine fault tolerance is an important part of the distributed system, which can solve the consensus problem in the scenario of both faults and malicious attacks in the distributed system. In a system where a subsystem has failed, it may not be clear which subsystem has failed. In other words, different observers on the system may not be able to reach a consensus on whether the system is malfunctioning. Under Byzantine fault tolerance, the system can continue to operate even if some nodes exhibit malicious behavior.|Byzantine Fault Tolerance（BFT）|
|4|Staking|The act of staking tokens (such as Polkadot's DOT, Ares' ARES) to produce valid blocks (and thus obtain block rewards).|Staking|
|5|Frame|Collection of modules that Substrate runs.|Frame|
|6|On-chain Governance|A system for upgrading the blockchain. It coordinates the voting of stakeholders to decide how to update the code of the network protocol.|On-chain Governance|
|7|On-chain Validation|Check whether the data of the aggregator and challenge on the Ares chain is true and accurate.|On-chain Validation|
|8|off-chain worker|The most important function of Substrate 2.0, this is a development module that allows the blockchain to perform advanced calculations or issue its own network requests to the outside world.|off-chain worker|
|9|Cross-chain|Through a technology, value can be directly circulated across chains and barriers between chains.|Cross-chain|
|10|Decentralized Finance(DeFi)|Decentralized finance is a major innovation of smart contracts in the blockchain field in traditional finance: At present, it mainly focuses on the four major sectors of decentralized lending, automated market makers, decentralized exchanges, and stable currency issuance. Realizing the decentralization of financial services has overturned certain service paradigms of traditional finance and is a major innovation in the field of financial technology.|Decentralized Finance (DeFi)|
|11|Non-Fungible Tokens(NFT)|Non-homogeneous tokens have unique, scarce and indivisible attributes. NFT applications are found in games, artworks, domain names, collectibles, virtual assets, real assets, and identities. Among them, games, artworks, and domain names are developing most rapidly.|Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)|
|12|Virtual Machine|Software environment used to imitate the software environment of a physical computer, but the virtual machine can run programs like a physical computer. The physical computer used to host the virtual machine can usually support multiple virtual machines.|Virtual Machine|
|13|Ethereum<br>Virtual Machine (EVM)|On Ethereum, in order to maintain a high degree of certainty of the results of smart contracts, the operating environment of smart contracts is very important. It runs through the operating system of the "Ethereum Virtual Machine", which better shields the underlying differences of each computer node, and better realizes the same result that different nodes execute the contract, that is, the certainty.|Ethereum<br>Virtual Machine (EVM)|
|14|Price Feeds|The system presents the real-time price of a certain cryptocurrency.|Price Feeds|
|15|Gas fee|Expenses incurred due to network congestion speeding up the process.|Gas fee|
|16|Verifiable Random Function (VRF)|After the block producer has packaged the block, a random number and proof (proof) are generated for the block and stored in the block. When other nodes receive the block, the proof and the random number are verified to be correct.|Verifiable Random Function (VRF)|
|17|Babe consensus|A block generation mechanism that runs between verification nodes and determines the new block producer.|Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension|
|18|Ink contract|ink! It is a smart contract language developed by Parity (Pokadot official technical team).|    |
|19|Web Assembly (WASM)|A new programming language and the compilation target of each language. WASM language provides highly optimized network computing capabilities. By introducing Wasm, the efficiency of data execution can be improved, and it is possible to run directly on the browser. With the help of Wasm's excellent performance and diverse data interfaces, a compatible and visual data structure can be defined. We can build a powerful Oracle module.|Web Assembly (WASM)|
|20|Layer 2|In order to solve network congestion and expand the blockchain ecosystem, users do not put all activities directly on the blockchain, but perform most of the activities outside the chain in the "Layer 2" protocol.|    |
|21|Rollup|Rollup is one of Layer-2 expansion methods. It moves calculations (and state storage) off-chain, but keeps some data for each transaction on the chain. In order to improve efficiency, they use a lot of fancy compression techniques, and replace data with calculations as much as possible. It will become the key scalability solution for Ethereum.|    |
|22|Optimistic rollup model|Optimistic rollup, they use fraud proof: the rollup contract tracks the entire history of its state root and the hash of each batch. If someone finds that a batch process has an incorrect post-state root, they can publish a certificate to the chain to prove that the batch process is calculated incorrectly. The contract will verify the proof and restore the batch and all subsequent batches.|Optimistic rollup model|
|23|Miner Extractable Value (MEV)|Miners can determine the order of processing transactions on the blockchain and use this ability to withdraw profits at the expense of users.|Miner Extractable Value (MEV)|
