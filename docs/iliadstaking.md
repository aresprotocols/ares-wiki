## General Outlook

Welcome to the Ares Iliad stake mining on BSC main network. 

http://iliad.aresprotocol.io/

#### Stake Mining Scheme(Current Model)

1.The reward ratio declines linearly as the amount of Staking increases. For example: when the amount of staking reaches 10,000, APY is 7,604%; When the amount of staking reaches 100,000, APY is 760%; When the amount of staking reaches 1 million, the APY is 76%.

2.Staked tokens and rewards are available to withdraw at any time.

3.Staking has two steps, first, send Approve to allow the transaction and click Staking to launch operation.

4.Withdrawal includes Unstake Tokens, Claim Rewards, Claim and Unstake; they all need on-chain transactions.

5.All processes above require a BNB gas fee; while you are operating, you shall guarantee a certain amount of transaction fee.

#### Stake Mining Scheme(Regular Mode)
1.It has three staking terms; they are 60days, 120days, 180days, APY is 35%, 40%, and 45%, respectively.

2.Staking rewards are available for withdrawal at any time; staked tokens are available for withdrawal after the ending of the regular term.

3.Same as 3 of the current mode.

4.Same as 4 of the current mode.

5.Same as 5 of the current mode.
